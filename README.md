# ðŸ“š C++ Modules Overview

Welcome to the C++ modules! This README provides an overview of the key concepts covered across all the modules you will encounter. These modules will take you from the basics of C++ to more advanced topics, ensuring a solid foundation in this powerful programming language.

## ðŸš€ Concepts Covered

### Module 00: Introduction to C++ Basics
- **Namespaces**: Organize code and prevent name collisions.
- **Classes and Objects**: Encapsulation of data and functions.
- **Member Functions**: Functions defined inside a class.
- **Initialization Lists**: Initialize member variables before the constructor body executes.
- **Static Members**: Shared between all instances of a class.
- **Const Keyword**: Define constants that cannot be changed after initialization.

### Module 01: Memory Allocation and File Handling
- **Pointers and References**: Variables that store memory addresses and aliases for existing variables.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Use of `new` and `delete` operators for runtime memory management.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files using streams.
- **The Stack vs. The Heap**: Difference between static and dynamic memory allocation.

### Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operators Overloading, and Canonical Form
- **Polymorphism**: Function and operator overloading for processing objects differently based on their type.
- **Operator Overloading**: Define behavior of operators for user-defined types.
- **Canonical Form**: Standard way of implementing classes, including constructors, destructors, and assignment operators.

### Module 03: Inheritance
- **Inheritance**: Create new classes based on existing ones.
- **Access Specifiers**: Control the accessibility of base class members to derived classes (`public`, `protected`, `private`).
- **Constructors and Destructors in Inheritance**: Ensure proper initialization and cleanup of objects in a class hierarchy.

### Module 04: Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
- **Virtual Functions**: Achieve polymorphism by allowing derived classes to override base class methods.
- **Abstract Classes**: Classes that cannot be instantiated and are meant to be inherited. They contain at least one pure virtual function.
- **Interfaces**: Abstract classes with only pure virtual functions that define a contract for derived classes.

### Module 05: Repetition and Exceptions
- **Exception Handling**: Use `try`, `catch`, and `throw` for runtime error handling.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Use of common classes and functions like vectors, lists, and algorithms.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Define specific error handling mechanisms.

### Module 06: C++ Casts
- **Static Cast**: Standard type conversions.
- **Dynamic Cast**: Safely downcast pointers and references in a hierarchy.
- **Const Cast**: Add or remove the `const` qualifier.
- **Reinterpret Cast**: Low-level casting between different pointer types.

## ðŸ“‚ Exercises
Each module includes a series of exercises designed to reinforce the concepts covered. We should ensure to complete these exercises and submit them as specified to gain hands-on experience with C++ programming.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
