# Module 01: Memory Allocation and Pointers üñ•Ô∏è

## Overview

Module 01 delves into intermediate concepts of C++ programming. This module covers important topics such as memory allocation, pointers, references, and switch statements. By the end of this module, you will have a deep understanding of memory management and pointers in C++.

## Topics Covered üìö

| Topic                     | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Allocation**     | Dynamic memory management using `new` and `delete` to allocate and deallocate memory during program execution. |
| **Pointers**              | Variables that store memory addresses, allowing for direct memory access and manipulation.            |
| **References**            | An alias for another variable, providing an alternative name for a variable.                          |
| **Switch Statement**      | A control statement that allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.        |
