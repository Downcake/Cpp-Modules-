# Module 03: Inheritance and Encapsulation üñ•Ô∏è

## Overview

Module 03 delves into the principles of inheritance and encapsulation in C++ programming. This module covers key topics such as class hierarchies, access specifiers, and special member functions. By the end of this module, you will have a strong understanding of how to design and implement class hierarchies and encapsulate data in C++.

## Topics Covered üìö

| Topic                         | Description                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance**               | Creating a new class (derived class) from an existing class (base class) to promote code reusability and establish a relationship between classes. |
| **Constructors and Destructors Chaining** | The process of calling constructors and destructors of base classes and derived classes in a specific order. |
| **Class Hierarchies**         | Organizing classes in a hierarchical structure to represent relationships and shared behavior.       |
| **Access Specifiers**         | Controlling access to class members using `public`, `protected`, and `private` keywords.             |
| **Special Member Functions**  | Functions automatically generated by the compiler under certain conditions, such as default constructors, copy constructors, and destructors. |
