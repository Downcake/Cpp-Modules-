# Module 02: Ad-Hoc Polymorphism and Operator Overloading üñ•Ô∏è

## Overview

Module 02 explores advanced concepts in C++ programming, focusing on ad-hoc polymorphism and operator overloading. This module covers essential topics such as the Orthodox Canonical class form, which ensures consistent and predictable behavior in class design. By the end of this module, you will have a strong grasp of polymorphism and operator overloading in C++.

## Topics Covered üìö

| Topic                                 | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ad-Hoc Polymorphism**               | Achieved through function and operator overloading, allowing different functions to have the same name but different implementations. |
| **Operator Overloading**              | Providing custom implementations for standard operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to work with user-defined types. |
| **Orthodox Canonical Class Form**     | A set of rules to ensure that classes are designed consistently, including a default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor. |
