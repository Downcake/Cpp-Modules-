### Module 04: Polymorphism and Abstract Classes üñ•Ô∏è

## Overview

Module 04 explores advanced concepts in C++ programming, focusing on polymorphism and abstract classes. This module covers essential topics such as interfaces, pure virtual functions, and implementing polymorphic behavior. By the end of this module, you will have a comprehensive understanding of polymorphism and abstract classes in C++.

## Topics Covered üìö

| Topic                       | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Polymorphism**            | The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance.   |
| **Abstract Classes**        | Classes that cannot be instantiated and are designed to be subclassed, containing at least one pure virtual function. |
| **Interfaces**              | Abstract classes with only pure virtual functions, serving as a contract for derived classes.        |
| **Pure Virtual Functions**  | Functions declared in a base class that have no definition in that class and must be overridden in derived classes. |

## Exercises üìù

| Exercise                                     | Objective                                                                |

| **Exercise 00: Polymorphism**                | Implementing polymorphism in classes.                                    |
| **Exercise 01: I don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire** | Implementing deep copies and managing dynamic memory.           |
| **Exercise 02: Abstract class**              | Implementing abstract classes to prevent instantiation of base classes.  |
| **Exercise 03: Interface & recap**           | Implementing interfaces and ensuring understanding of module concepts.   |
